# Persist war state and make faction claims dimension-aware

- Fixed warp tents and medical tents in non-overworld dimensions by resolving their owning claim with the tile entity's actual world dimension instead of the implicit overworld.
- Fixed statue and other prestige-building owner detection in non-overworld dimensions so prestige generation is credited to the faction that owns that dimension's claim.
- Fixed prestige-building break cleanup to use the block's world dimension when subtracting generation, preventing non-overworld buildings from looking up overworld claims.
- Added immediate City Center prestige UI refresh when a faction's prestige generation changes, without changing the prestige tick/earning interval.
- Added a City Center GUI `Gain: <amount>/h` line so players can see whether statues and other prestige buildings changed generation.
- Restored ally object references from saved ally names during Clowder NBT load and synchronized ally names before saving, fixing alliances disappearing from runtime commands after server restart.
- Kept the prior dimension-aware city/admin-claim and war-runtime persistence work from this PR.

## Manual verification notes

- In a Nether/End/LOTR/Middle-earth claim, place a warp tent on valid foundation blocks with sky access, run `/c setwarp <name>`, restart, and verify `/c warp <name>` still targets that dimension.
- In a non-overworld city claim, place a statue and each enabled prestige building, then open the City Center GUI and verify the `Gain` line updates within a tick or two without waiting for the hourly prestige interval.
- Break those prestige buildings in the same non-overworld claim and verify the City Center GUI generation drops immediately.
- Create and accept an alliance, restart the server, and verify `/c alliance`, `/c allywarp`, and ally war defense checks still recognize the ally.
- Load a legacy world missing dimension fields and verify legacy homes/warps still migrate to dimension `0` with clear server log messages.

## Remaining risky assumptions

- Some legacy helper overloads still intentionally default to dimension `0`; new gameplay code should prefer `World`/dimension-aware overloads.
- The City Center GUI now displays prestige generation (`/h`) immediately, but actual prestige balance accrual still follows the configured prestige update interval by design.
