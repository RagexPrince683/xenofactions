# A new fork reviving the OG 1.7.10 factions Mod.

Xenofactions is a modification of the mod "Xradar" a factions mod made by Bobcat for the "Tyrants and Plebians" war server. It is primarily for our own server "Ragecraft" but is here for all to download aswell. 

## List of changes
- Fixes to various broken commands, like /c apply (now can be used without admin permissions)
- By default the FMU+ radars are disabled for compatiblity with Mcheli
- Updated stone drop logic, allowing for modded ores (can be customized via json or commands)
...and many more to come. 

All we ask is that you give credit to either "Ragex", "The Swamp", or "Swag Gang" if you use this mod for your own 1.7.10 war server. Enjoy!
